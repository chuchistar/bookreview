<p> <u>The One and Only Ivan</u> 8-10</p>
<p>Ivan is an easygoing gorilla. Living at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and   Video Arcade, he has grown accustomed to humans watching him through the   glass walls of his domain. He rarely misses his life in the jungle. In   fact, he hardly ever thinks about it at all.Instead, Ivan thinks about TV shows he's seen and about his   friends Stella, an elderly elephant, and Bob, a stray dog. But mostly   Ivan thinks about art and how to capture the taste of a mango or the   sound of leaves with color and a well-placed line.Then he meets Ruby, a baby elephant taken from her family, and   she makes Ivan see their home—and his own art—through new eyes. When   Ruby arrives, change comes with her, and it's up to Ivan to make it a   change for the better.</p>
<p><u>Review</u></p>
<p>I thought this was an intresting book because there is animals in a mall in the circus. I love when the new elephant Ruby asks stella or ivan to tell her stories. i also love the ending. It is such a happy and perfect ending for a book like this. I think this is a great book for people who are animal lovers ,and think that animals should not be captured to entertain people because there are soooo many other ways to be entertained.</p>

<p><u>Heiddi</u></p>
<p align="justify"> The orphan child <em>Heidi</em> first lives with her aunt Dete, but Dete would   like to concentrate on her career. So she brings Heidi to her grandfather,   a queer old man living in an alpine cottage far from the next village  (he is therefore called Alm-Uncle, <em>Alpöhi</em> or <em>Almöhi</em> in German).  Alm-Uncle is good-hearted but mistrusts anybody and wants to keep the child from  all evils of the world. So he refuses to send Heidi to school; instead  she goes to the pastures, together with Peter, a shepherd boy looking after   the goats (<em>Geissenpeter</em> = goat-Peter in German).  This (all too harmonious) apine idyll finds a sudden end when aunt Dete   comes in again and brings Heidi to Frankfurt (Germany) where she shall  stay with Clara, the paralyzed daughter of a rich family, and learn   something. </p>
<p align="justify"> Thanks to the grandmother of Clara, Heidi learns to read but she can't  get acquainted to the strict discipline in a bourgeois upper class house  (personified by governess Fraulein Rottenmeier). She is very lonesome and  gets depressed by the gray anonymous city. Heidi becomes ill of <em>homesickness</em>,  she starts to walk in her sleep. Miss Rottenmeier is alarmed, not because  of the fate of the poor child, but rather because she thinks that there  are ghosts in the old house. Finally Clara's father Herr Stresemann and   the sympathetic doctor of the family decide to stay up till midnight and  find out about the ghosts. When the doctor sees Heidi walking around in  her sleep, he finds the right diagnosis and sends her back to the alps. </p>
<p align="justify"> Next summer, Clara visits Heidi there. They go to the pastures and Heidi  shows Clara all the beauty of her world.    Peter gets terribly jealous, and in a moment when he feels unobserved,  he pushes the empty wheelchair down to the valley so it gets smashed.  Clara wants to see the flowers and is forced to walk -  and her desire  is strong enough that she overcomes her handicap. Healings at   body, spirit and soul in that healthy Alpine world - end well, all well. </p>
